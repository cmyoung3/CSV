This program is designed to display both the Sitka and Death Valley airport temperatures over the course of a year. It does this by importing comma seperated values (CSV) of weather readings. In these readings we take the high, low, and date information. After we take that information we plot it using plotly. We use the subplot method to have both plots display at once, making sure that we have 1 row and 2 columns.
